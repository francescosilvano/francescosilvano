## About
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering Management at the University of Siena, where I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics and Banking.

My current professional development priorities are centred on enhancing my proficiency in programming and business management. I am particularly interested in projects within the following fields:

- RegTech: Automating compliance and regulatory intelligence
- FinTech: Open banking and open finance
- Energy Management Data-driven efficiency and innovation
