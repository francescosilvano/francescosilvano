## Connecting the dots...

Graduated in Economics and Banking at the University of Siena. Currently completing a Master’s in Engineering Management at the same university. I am specializing in financial technology, with a focus on leveraging innovation to create impactful solutions in finance and beyond. 

#### Current projects
I am currently working on two open-source projects. The first is software designed to help financial analysts make better use of LLMs in their work, set for release by April 2026. The second is a regulatory compliance management system aimed at streamlining compliance workflows in SMEs.
