## Connecting the dots...

### Bio

Undergraduate in Economics and Banking, currently pursuing graduate studies in Engineering Management at the University of Siena, Italy. Through my courses and independent studies, I have developed a strong interest in financial technology and cybersecurity, particularly at the intersection of payments, risk and investment management. I aim to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and security in these areas.

In my free time you’ll find me organizing my inbox (color-coded, of course), perfecting my coffee-to-email ratio, or explaining to friends why “just cc’ing everyone” is not a best practice.
